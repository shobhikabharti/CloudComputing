- [ ] 31 JAN 2022 > Well, I completed my PMP two times in the last quarter of 2022, and now, I have to start my prep. Somebody suggested me the YouTube link for revision https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEWFSKHjyrwz_UKPl-jeSan5NU7RH3KRD. Very good content here, hopefully, my PMP is over in 120 days with case studies. Changed the target from 100 to 120 as life never happens in isolation. Also, we should study at our own pace, not too delayed, not too much in a hurry. If we want to learn something, do that study with use cases and a lot of examples to understand what 40+ years old person went through. I'm also younger in that comparison, but PMBOK concepts are tried, tested & implemented, why reinvent the wheel? So, let's start the countdown...   

PMP Journey starts here ...  
- [ ] 14 FEB 2023 > because I'm running too many things in parallel, I deferred PMP to May, but I have to be on my heels now, because it is getting deferred again. Well, the problem is I cannot get time to revise the content at all with Cloud and other programs, but then, I don't want to drag it way too much. So, here's the story of my PMP which I have a feeling would be burdened one as I have two PG programs to finsih in this year. But I'm managing, let's see how'd I do that from today onwards as I already submitted my assignments for one of them...   
- [ ] 15 FEB 2023 > Revised Agile Scrum Master slides for the start  
- [ ] 24 FEB 2023 > Putting it on hold, mission PMP will start once I finish GCP Cloud Engineer, but I'm going to track it for 100 days as I have already attended training and went through material.  Actually, I need 2-3 weeks continuously to attempt this paper, but I'm constantly engaged in multiple tracks in office and at home. Sometimes, I think, do I have a life right now? No. Hence, I am working on wellness too, can't really cram or skim, it is PMP after all.

- [ ] 16 MAR 2023 > Completed my GCP Training yesterday, preparing for certification now. Meanwhile, since I am losing track of time on PMP, registered myself for 18 days training session in the month of April again. My plan is take mock exam, then take date for the PMP somewhere in June, let's see. Original date was May 11th, but even a manager has to reschedule a lot of things because of the market disruption. I will update on daily basis starting next month. Till then, have fun.
