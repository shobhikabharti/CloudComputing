- [ ] 31 JAN 2022 > Well, I completed my PMP two times in the last quarter of 2022, and now, I have to start my prep. Somebody suggested me the YouTube link for revision https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEWFSKHjyrwz_UKPl-jeSan5NU7RH3KRD. Very good content here, hopefully, my PMP is over in 100 days. Let's start the countdown...   

PMP Journey starts here ...  
- [ ] 14 February 2023 > because I'm running too many things in parallel, I deferred PMP to May, but I have to be on my heels now, because it is getting deferred again. Well, the problem is I cannot get time to revise the content at all with Cloud and other programs, but then, I don't want to drag it way too much. So, here's the story of my PMP which I have a feeling would be burdened one as I have two PG programs to finsih in this year. But I'm managing, let's see how'd I do that from today onwards as I already submitted my assignments for one of them...   
- [ ] 15 February 2023 > Revised Agile Scrum Master slides for the start  
- [ ] 24 February 2023 > Putting it on hold, mission PMP will start once I finish GCP Cloud Engineer, but I'm going to track it for 100 days as I have already attended training and went through material.  Actually, I need 2-3 weeks continuously to attempt this paper, but I'm constantly engaged in multiple tracks in office and at home. Sometimes, I think, do I have a life right now? No. Hence, I am working on wellness too, can't really cram or skim, it is PMP after all.
