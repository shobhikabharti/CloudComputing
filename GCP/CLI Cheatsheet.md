**gcloud format**

gcloud + release level (optional) + component + entity + operation + positional args + flags  
For example: gcloud + compute + instances + create + example-instance-1 + --zone=us-central1-a  

**Release level**
Release Level refers to the commandâ€™s release status.  

Example: alpha for alpha commands, beta for beta commands, no release level needed for GA commands.  

**Component**  
Component refers to the different Google Cloud services.

Operation refers to the imperative verb form of the operation to be performed on the entity.  

Example: Common operations are describe, list, create/update, delete/clear, import, export, copy, remove, add, reset, restart, restore, run, and deploy.  

**Positional args**  
Positional args refer to the required, order-specific arguments needed to execute the command.  

Example: <INSTANCE_NAMES> is the required positional argument for gcloud compute instances create.
