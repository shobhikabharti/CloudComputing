1. **Spring Initializr** : Spring Initializr is to fill in the metadata, add the relevant dependencies, and generate your new project.
2. **JSON** : A Data Contract is a formal agreement between a service and a client that abstractly communicates the data to be exchanged. The client and the service do not have to share the same programming language, only the same data contracts. Other variations YAML & XML. JSON is the most popular data interchange format for modern web-based applications. JSON contracts help guarantee that app developers and consumers agree upon and will use the same JSON data structures when building and using an application. JSON contracts help with this consistency not only by encouraging the various parties to collaborate, but also by supporting automated testing and verification of the contracts.
3. **Test Driven Development** : It’s common for software development teams to author automated test suites to guard against regressions. Often these tests are written after the production code is authored. The best time to refactor the code you're currently focusing on is during the TDD cycle. This is called the Red, Green, Refactor development loop:  
        a. Red: Write a failing test for the desired functionality.  
        b. Green: Implement the simplest thing that can work to make the test pass.  
        c. Refactor: Look for opportunities to simplify, reduce duplication, or otherwise improve the code without changing any behavior—to refactor.  
        d. Repeat!
