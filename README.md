## The Journey
1. Revisit the Cloud Basics :speech_balloon:
2. Come up with the learning plan :dash:
3. Make a point to stick to the plan and make wellness a point too :curry:
4. Upload the content here on daily basis :notes:
5. Be presentation ready on your content :thumbsup:
6. Live in the glory of the learned brain :sparkles:
7. Now that you have learned cloud, take a break, go for an outing...:checkered_flag: :moyai:  

** To Pursue Cloud Computing Mastery path, one should have 4-7 years of hands-on experience on the DevOps, Microservices, Security, and Full Stack Architecture Design Patterns. I would recommend you to revisit few IT related courses preferably around IT networking and Linux fundamentals for in-depth knowledge in these areas before venturing on the Cloud. To be frank, it depends on the experience level and your interest in the Cloud to come up with flying colors in this area. For the starters, take a cloud practitioner/essentials course exam and gets hands-on on cloud, it would take 6 months and anybody can take it whether you are 18 yrs. old or 40 yrs. old, it doesn't matter, just hop on to your cloud express :bullettrain_front:. Just make sure that you don't mug up things for a while but it should be pragmatic exprerience as well. And, if you're planning for masters, select your masters' programme as per your interest and continue on technical area side by side:vertical_traffic_light:. For more, you can keep my YouTube Playlist below as a reference, I keep on updating these as per industry requirements

- [ ] 13 SEP 2022 > So, in the next few days, I'm going to put myself in motion so that I enjoy cloud ride along with my work. For this, I'm going through few Bootcamps on Udemy, Practice tests, and Exam Prep readiness material everyday since naming conventions are different in every cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) but I'm taking AWS first. And, I have to read blogs, docs, news, and new features around it as well.
- [ ] 14 SEP 2022 > Going through few topics on Cloud again, from the next month onwards, my classes would start and I am going to post my activity seldom here

- [ ] 18 OCT 2022 > Busy with the Partner events from past few weeks, gonna update my progress on the Cloud Exam soon ...  
- [ ] 20 OCT 2022 > After being enticed by Cloud right from the beginning, I was so hesitant when I started with the AWS in the month of August, but it felt like Computer Science with different nomenclature, so, I continued. Although, I have experience in every area of IT and Development but still, Cloud is a Cloud. Phew! I feel alright now ... FOMO can become real sometimes... Next, Azure & GCP, will update in the next year. Today, I got a link to AWS Resources https://resources.awscloud.com/   
- [ ] 29 OCT 2022 > Still attending training from AWS on components...Well, it may differ from person to person but as an architect brain, I like to study everything in one go. However, I was busy in too many training, hence, I could not study for certfication in the last month, I'll take it the coming months. As of now, I'm entering into the lab assignments phase which would take another month to hands-on on components    
- [ ] 9 NOV 2022 > Still in training mode, but I learned about partner compentency program https://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/competencies/  

## Into the bushy, thorny forest

## Trekking the dunes

## Winding through the canyons

## Stumbling through the caves

## Resting at the Lagoon

## Up into the mountains

## Into the sky to touch the cloud!
