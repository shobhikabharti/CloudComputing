## The Journey
1. Revisit the Cloud Basics :speech_balloon:
2. Come up with the learning plan :dash:
3. Make a point to stick to the plan and make wellness a point too :curry:
4. Upload the content here on daily basis :notes:
5. Be presentation ready on your content :thumbsup:
6. Live in the glory of the learned brain :sparkles:
7. Now that you have learned cloud, take a break, go for an outing...:checkered_flag: :moyai:

** To Pursue Cloud Computing Mastery path, one should have 4-7 years of hands-on experience on the DevOps, Microservices, Security, and Full Stack Architecture Design Patterns. I would recommend you to revisit few IT related courses preferably around IT networking and Linux fundamentals for in-depth knowledge in these areas before venturing on the Cloud. To be frank, it depends on the experience level and your interest in the Cloud to come up with flying colors in this area. Just make sure that you don't mug up things for a while but it should be pragmatic exprerience as well. For more, you can keep my YouTube Playlist as a reference, I keep on updating these as per industry requirements

## Trekking the dunes

## Winding through the canyons

## Stumbling through the caves

## Resting at the Lagoon
