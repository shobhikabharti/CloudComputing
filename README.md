## The Journey
1. Revisit the Cloud Basics :speech_balloon:
2. Come up with the learning plan :dash:
3. Make a point to stick to the plan and make wellness a point too :curry:
4. Upload the content here on daily basis :notes:
5. Be presentation ready on your content :thumbsup:
6. Live in the glory of the learned brain :sparkles:
7. Now that you have learned cloud, take a break, go for an outing...:checkered_flag: :moyai:

** To Pursue Cloud Computing Mastery path, one should have 5-7 years of hands-on experience on the DevOps, Microservices, Security, and Full Stack Architecture. I would recommend you to revisit few courses for in-depth knowledge in these areas before venturing on the Cloud. For more, you can keep my YouTube Playlist as a reference, I keep on updating these as per industry requirements

## Walking down the road

## Crossing the bridge

## Into the bushy, thorny forest

## Trekking the dunes

## Winding through the canyons

## Stumbling through the caves

## Resting at the Lagoon

## Up into the mountains

## Into the sky to touch the cloud!
