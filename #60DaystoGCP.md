** DISCLAIMER: This is not 40 days continuous journey to certification as initially advised. But since I had 45 hours workweek and weekend classes as well while taking the exam, I had to start the countdown somewhere so that I take the certification ASAP. However, if you've time, I would suggest 45 days of self study around GCP Engineer prep material on Google Cloud portal (including labs) + 10 days of exam prep questions prep from Udemy and voila, CERTIFIED!  

However, if you're on a Beast Mode, 30 days of self study + 10 days of questionnaire, but for how many exams can we be on a beast mode, hence, I enjoyed food too, instead of following a strict diet during exam time. :D
